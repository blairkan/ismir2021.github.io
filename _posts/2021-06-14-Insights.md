In a typical year at ISMIR, around 300 submissions are read and reviewed by 4 people each. This huge effort, expended voluntarily by fellow community members, is vital to ensuring the high quality of research published at ISMIR.

As _researchers_, we are all eventually called on to review the work of others. But what is expected of us as ISMIR _reviewers_?

For the most part, what&#39;s expected is communicated clearly: each year, reviewers are reminded of the [ISMIR Reviewer Guidelines](https://ismir.net/reviewer-guidelines/). Those new to reviewing may also want to read [examples of ISMIR reviews (along with commentary and advice)](https://tomcollinsresearch.net/pdf/ismirReviewExamples.pdf) provided by Tom Collins.

However, since reviewing is a solitary act, even experienced reviewers may wonder: how long do my peers spend writing reviews? How much of an expert on a topic should I be before I can review a paper about it? Does anyone else worry about the same things I do when reviewing?

To learn more about the secret art of reviewing, we sent an anonymous survey to all meta-reviewers from this year and last, asking these questions and more. In the rest of this post, we report the results.

To be clear, this is **not** intended to be an instruction manual for reviewers; instead, consider it an overview of how experienced ISMIR reviewers view this task.

==========

## Participants &amp; Experience

To start with, we want to thank all the participants in the survey! We received 46 responses --- roughly half of those invited --- and it is clear that each respondent spent a lot of time to craft their responses to our sometimes specific, sometimes open-ended questions. Thank you!

## Question 1. How many years have you reviewed papers for ISMIR?

Responses were evenly distributed, with about a quarter of respondents in each 5-year band: 1–5 years; 5–10 years; 10–15 years; and 15–20 years.

## Question 2. What was your level of seniority the first time you reviewed for ISMIR?

Almost half of reviewers started reviewing for ISMIR while pursuing a PhD, and another 20% had a PhD. Around 30% started while already faculty; perhaps they were faculty when ISMIR was founded, or perhaps they rose to a faculty level while focused on another field before joining the ISMIR community.

## Questions 3–4. In what capacity have you reviewed papers for ISMIR? For other venues?

We invited 95 participants, who had all reviewed and meta-reviewed for ISMIR (or were about to meta-review for the first time). Of the 46 who responded:

- 15 had served as Scientific program chair for ISMIR;
- 45 had reviewed for another conference;
- 30 had meta-reviewed for another conference;
- 21 had served as Scientific program chair for another conference.

So, the respondents to this survey seem to skew toward the experienced end of meta-reviewers, and all seem equipped to put their experience reviewing for ISMIR in context with other venues.

## Question 5. How did you learn to review papers?

Here are the available responses, ranked by response frequency:

Most of this learning is passive: reading the instructions, and learning from the reviews one has received in the past.

Only two of the options (&quot;asked colleagues&quot;, &quot;formal mentorship&quot;) imply real contact with other people, and at least 34% of respondents did not select either.

## Question 6. Have you ever felt unqualified to review a paper? What do you think makes someone a qualified reviewer?

Most respondents (at least 60%) owned up to sometimes feeling unqualified in some way:

_&quot;Absolutely! As a junior reviewer I would often feel overwhelmed and not fit to judge the work or more senior people (imposter syndrome).&quot;_

_&quot;Yes, and I have declined to review them as soon as I realised it.&quot;_

_&quot;[Yes, but] this can be largely avoided when there is a proper bidding process.&quot;_

Sometimes, this is reason enough to request a new reviewer. On the other hand, several said that some humility about one&#39;s expertise is important and not disqualifying:

_&quot;This happens very often, and is rather the normal case when [doing] interdisciplinary [work].&quot;_

_&quot;Yes, self-doubt is a part of the research process! Essentially, I think we should strive for truly &quot;peer&quot; reviews and not a senior vs. junior setup.&quot;_

What _does_ qualify a reviewer then? Responses varied, but a few themes pervaded: (1) some expertise on the subject matter; (2) knowledge of the expectations of the ISMIR community; (3) knowledge of scientific work and writing generally.

_&quot;A reviewer is qualified when the paper falls inside their area of expertise and they have experience in writing papers as lead authors.&quot;_

_&quot;You need experience as a scientific writer. You need to acknowledge that there are many &#39;correct&#39; ways of writing a paper, not just yours.&quot;_

_&quot;I don&#39;t believe one needs to be a super-specialised expert to review a paper –-- just one such review is sufficient –-- but one does need to be in the target audience for the conference/journal.&quot;_

_&quot;One needs knowledge of the topic, and an understanding of 1) the scientific method, and 2) the publication process.&quot;_

_&quot;Expertise in relation to at least some aspects of a paper may be a criterion of being qualified, but then again papers should also be comprehensible for reviewers without expertise related to the subject of a paper.&quot;_

Some respondents told us about strategies they use to inform authors and editors about their expertise:

_&quot;[If I feel unqualified, I will] either decline the invitation to perform the review [...] or announce in the review form that I&#39;m not qualified and will concentrate on the form of the paper (rather than the content); most important I will avoid making strong statements (such as Strong accept or Strong reject).&quot;_

_&quot;[...] I usually include a disclaimer at the beginning of the review that identifies the areas of the paper where I have less experience (topic, methods, etc.) so the meta-reviewer and authors can take that into account [...]&quot;._

## **Reviewing Effort**

## Question 7. How long are your ISMIR reviews?

For this question, respondents indicated their own unit: words, paragraphs, or pages. There was a lot of variation: some regularly write reviews as short as 100 words or 1--2 paragraphs; others regularly write 2-page reviews with over a dozen paragraphs.

However, the median length for each unit --- 1 page, 3–5 paragraphs, 400–500 words --- were also the most typical answers. These are all probably reasonable guidelines.

(In the above plots, an answer like &quot;6--8 paragraphs&quot; adds 1 to the height of columns 6, 7, and 8.)

## Question 8. How long _should_ reviews be?

When asked to _recommend_ a length, respondents were split.

Around half ventured a concrete number. Of these, 90% gave the exact same length that they gave in the previous question, and the others gave something shorter.

The other half declined to offer a specific number. Of these, almost all used one of two phrases to explain why: &quot;long enough&quot; or &quot;it depends&quot;.

_&quot;No specified length is needed --- depends on the quality of the paper and the feedback required.&quot;_

_&quot;As long as it takes to explain why the paper is good or bad.&quot;_

_&quot;As long as they need to be to improve the paper.&quot;_

_&quot;Long enough to help the committee make a reasoned decision and to give the authors helpful feedback.&quot;_

_&quot;The length of the review fully depends on the quality of the work.&quot;_

_&quot;I don&#39;t think there is a general appropriate length. This should be dependent on the paper. A very good paper with not much to criticize, or a barely readable paper should [not] need very long reviews, while borderline papers may require more content for further discussions with other reviewers/meta.&quot;_

In other words: there is substantial variation in how long reviews are going to be, and many reviewers feel this variation is justified.

## Question 9. How many hours do you spend on a review?

The average estimated time spent was 3 hours per review. We spend a lot of time reviewing ISMIR papers!

As ever, though, there was a huge amount of variation, with some estimating as little as 30 minutes and others as long as 8. (A few wrote &quot;half a day&quot;, which I took to mean 6 hours.)

![](/assets/img/blog/insights4.png)

Many noted that the same caveat about review length applies here: &quot;it depends.&quot;

_&quot;Depends on familiarity with [the] material and how easy the paper is to read.&quot;_

_&quot;1-5 hours depending on [the] quality of paper.&quot;_

_&quot;Between 4 and 8 hours, maybe more depending on the paper.&quot;_

_&quot;Depends on how knowledgeable I am on the topic, how well the paper is written (readability), and how many comments I need to make; I guess, about 45 minutes per paper (I have never measured this)&quot;_

Also, many reviewers noted that they might not spend all this time in one go:

_&quot;Probably around 2 hours total: 60-90 minutes to read in detail, 30-60 minutes to write the review. That said, (ISMIR only) I find it helps to do the reviews before the deadline, and then come back to them a week or so later to give a second look and see if I feel the same.&quot;_

_&quot;1/2 day (but spread over several days to have the time to think about the content)&quot;_

## Question 10. How many hours _should_ you spend?

Once again, most respondents indicated the exact same time here as in the previous question, although some indicated that spending an hour or two less is desirable.

_&quot;Would love to keep all reviews under 1 hour&quot;_

_&quot;I&#39;ve been told that one can review in about 1-2 hours, but I just can&#39;t seem to go faster than 2-3 hours.&quot;_

And, as ever, it depends!

_&quot;45 min to 90 min; does not need to be in one go --- reading on one day, writing on another day is a good practice&quot;_

_&quot;Long enough to provide a critical, comprehensive, and helpful review&quot;_

## To be continued

Unpacking down this survey turned into a larger project than anticipated, so we&#39;ve decided to split the content into two installments. Please stay tuned for an imminent follow-up, which will cover what survey respondents felt about reviewing methods, handling problems, and reading others&#39; reviews.
