Dear ISMIR community,

We are happy to announce that ISMIR2021 [(https://ismir2021.ismir.net)](https://ismir2021.ismir.net) is inviting labs to our Lab Showcase, a new ISMIR activity! This call is open to _academic_ labs _focusing on MIR research_. To avoid overlap, we accept _no more than one lab from each institution_ (but labs are welcome to team up).

**Lab Showcase:**

Lab Showcase is an activity introduced this year at ISMIR where every attendant lab will be allocated a virtual booth. We hope this provides an opportunity for lab members to introduce their work to the conference attendees, thus encouraging further communications/collaborations.The virtual booths provide tools for exchanging text messages, making video calls and uploading materials. The booth time is flexible and up to the labs, but we expect a minimum availability of two pre-determined time slots for live chats. What to share in the booths is totally up to the labs.

**Submission Guidelines:**

We need the following information in submissions:

1. Lab name, affiliation (institution), and country;
2. Principle director(s) and contact email(s);
3. A brief lab introduction (about one paragraph)

Submission form: [(https://bit.ly/ismir2021labs)](https://bit.ly/ismir2021labs)
