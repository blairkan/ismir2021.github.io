{% include toc.html %}

LBD session is a forum for sharing prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results which have not yet fully matured but are of interest to the Music-IR community. It is also a great entry point for people who are new to ISMIR to showcase their preliminary work and receive early feedback from fellow researchers. In addition to the standard LBD track, we are happy to announce a **special opt-in track** to support and encourage people **who are attending ISMIR for the first time**. This track includes a mentoring process that provides constructive feedback to the authors.

Those interested should follow the submission guidelines (see below) and submit extended abstracts through the system. The accepted abstracts must be presented by at least one author as a poster during the LBD session. **Note that the LBD abstract is not a conference paper and will not be part of the official ISMIR 2021 proceedings.**

- Time zone: Anywhere On Earth (AOE)
- Submission open: August 20 (Fri), 2021
- Submission deadline: October 11 (Mon), 2021
- Notification of acceptance: October 26 (Tue), 2021

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions must comply with the following requirements:
- Length (2+1): two pages (maximum) of content plus one optional page for bibliography only.
- Templates: make sure to use the latest templates [available for Latex and Word](https://github.com/ismir/paper_templates). Submissions must be in PDF format.

- Supplementary material (optional): authors are encouraged to submit a demo video that facilitates the screening process (5 minutes or less, mp4, h264 codec, 100MB or less, with closed captions).
- Final poster size: no larger than A0 or 36 x 48 inch (portrait orientation)

All submissions will be screened for the following criteria:

## Special Opt-in Track: New-to-ISMIR

To support young researchers and newcomers to the MIR community, the LBD session at ISMIR 2021 specifically welcomes contributions by junior researchers or practitioners to demonstrate their work. 

**Mentoring process:** all submissions under this special track will be mentored by volunteers in the ISMIR community, providing the authors with constructive feedback for potential improvements in their camera-ready versions. 

**Financial support:** to qualify for this track, the first author must be a first-time attendee of ISMIR. Participants who satisfy one or more of the following criteria may also be eligible for financial aid:
- An enrolled student during the 2020-2021 academic year and/or the 2021-2022 academic year
- Participants or mentees from the 2020-2021 WiMIR workshop/mentorship program
- Self-identifies as an underrepresented minority (e.g., in terms of gender, sexual orientation, race, country of origin)

## Topics of Interest

The late-breaking/demo session welcomes topics interesting to the MIR community, as specified in the main [call for papers](https://ismir2021.github.io/cfp/), with a special focus on prototype systems, initial concepts, and early results. We aim to provide an inclusive forum that facilitates the discussion of MIR projects in their early stages.

In the New-to-ISMIR special track, we especially welcome submissions from junior researchers who would benefit from the mentoring process. In addition to the topics described above, we encourage the following types of submissions:
- Proof of concepts for new MIR methods
- MIR-focused school projects
- Case-studies involving MIR

## Guidelines for mentors (New-to-ISMIR track only)

### Technical guidelines

As soon as you are notified of your assigned papers, please check all of them to make sure that: 
1) the research topic is suitable for ISMIR
2) the authorsâ€™ names should not be anonymized (single-blind), and
3) the papers fit the ISMIR LBD format. Please notify the LBD chairs immediately if any of these issues arise. Due to the time limitations, please complete your assignments within the designated time frame. 

### Comments for the mentees

The goals of this mentoring process are:
1) provide junior/new researchers immediate feedback regarding their submissions,
2) provide them an opportunity to experience a light-weight review process from the community, and
3) help them improve their submissions and facilitate more effective discussions during the conference. To achieve these goals, we recommend you to consider the following dimensions while giving feedback:
- Content: 
    - Is this topic well-motivated? 
    - Is the task well-defined?
    - While it is challenging to comment on the technical details given the limited length, it is still worthwhile to point out the strengths and the potential weaknesses of the presented work. Particularly, your comments regarding the missing details could help the mentees re-examine their work and include these details in their camera ready version and the final poster. 
- Presentation:
    - Is the idea/project clearly presented in the paper? Is the writing and the use of language appropriate? Are the figures/tables/equations well-formulated? Is the demo video (if any) self-explanatory? 
    - Does the extended abstract have a clear structure with balanced sections? To further develop this submission into a full paper, what sections are still missing?
- Other comments:
    - We welcome your general feedback/suggestions to the mentees, including (but not limited to) your thoughts on the potential extensions of their work, open questions to contemplate, and additional references and resources for their considerations.
    - We also encourage you to provide your thoughts/tips on how to effectively communicate the ideas and trigger meaningful conversations during the actual LBD poster session (e.g., visualization strategies of the results, section to focus on, etc.).
